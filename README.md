This Repository contains the odds and ends solutions to any code golf problems I encounter and resolve to solve.  I promise to update this rarely, if ever, never document or unit test anything, provide no context or explanation, and violate any other best practice I can manage to subvert, avoid, or otherwise flout.

Basically, you should ignore this repository.

If that doesn't deter you adequately, I am happy for you to peruse my solutions.  All code is copyright 2014, Tony Boyles and distributed under the most recent MIT License.

Cheers!
